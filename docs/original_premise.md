The Morph Games are played in a large, maze-like dungeon/arena. Scattered throughout are numerous chests, traps, monsters, and even the occasional friendly being. The goal is to collect the magic rings; once all the rings are collected, the game ends.

The map consists of a maze-like area. Scattered throughout are numerous "rooms" - large open areas, some of which might have a very different asthethic to the dungeon itself (such as a small forest chamber). Many dungeons have a river or lake running through them; sufficently aquatic sorts can traverse these as shortcuts, but they often have their own dangers. In a few cases, dungeons have have streams or lakes of lava either instead, or in addition to, the more traditional water.

characters have a few basic stats:
* determines physical damage, carrying capacity
* agility, determines evasion and to-hit chances
* dexterity determines ability of perform fine manipulation of objects
* toughness, determines health, recovery, and resistance to poisons

Every chest contains exactly one thing. This thing can be:
* magic talismans
* mutations
* equippables (may have minimum dexterity)
* potions/consumables (ie. healing, etc.)
* worthless junk

monsters are scattered about the dungeon. There is no XP reward for combat, though they may sometimes drop non-ring chest loot. Avoiding monsters is best, but not always an option.

traps are also scattered about. they are simple affairs, and may damage the triggerer, or apply the effect of a mutation, or potion, or poison.

poison causes persistant damage, until it wears off with a successful toughness check; also initial check on application

curses are negative status effects that cause negative effects for characters, or even effect what actions they can take. curses are resisted on application with willpower, and when attemptign a prohibited action; lasts until successful check.

rooms typically contain multiple traps and monsters, but also multiple chests making them high risk, high reward
