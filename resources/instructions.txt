The goal of MorphRL is to delve into a randomly generated dungeon in pursuit of
one of the pieces of ethereal ore located on the very bottom floor. You begin
with very little equipment and are opposed by a range of monsters, and by the
transformative nature of the dungeon itself.

You can at any point press the escape key to leave the current game menu, or to
return to the main menu if a game is in progress. [color=red]Beware[/color], however! MorphRL
currently does [color=red]not[/color] support saving, so if you quit before finishing a run, you
will not be able to resume it.

Movement through the dungeon is straight-forward. You character is represented
by the [color=#7FFF7F]@[/color] symbol and you can move around using the numeric keypad. The arrow
keys also work, but do not allow for diagonal movement.
Many rooms and corridors are separated by doors; trying    Floor -> [color=#FFFFFF]..[color=#A52A2A]+[/color] <- door
to move into a door will open it. You can also open          you -> [color=#7FFF7F]@[color=#FFFFFF].[color=#7F7F7F]#[/color] <- wall
and close adjacent doors using the ‘[color=yellow]o[/color]’ key. When you      goblin -> [color=#FF7F7F]g[color=#FFFFFF].[color=#7F7F7F]/[/color] <- item
are standing on a staircase (‘[color=yellow]<[/color]’ or ‘[color=yellow]>[/color]’), you can      up stairs -> [color=#FFFFFF]<..[/color]
press the period or comma keys to climb up and down
them.

You can access your character sheet with the ‘[color=yellow]c[/color]’ key and view and use your
inventory with ‘[color=yellow]i[/color]’. You can see a log of all past messages by pressing ‘[color=yellow]l[/color]’. If
you press ‘[color=yellow]x[/color]’ you can move the cursor around the dungeon to see exactly what is
occupying any given space.

Engaging in combat with the monsters of the dungeon (represented by the letters
of the alphabet) is performed by trying to move into their space. This will
automatically cause you to perform a melee attack. But be careful! The monsters
are going to try and do the same thing to you. Once you've defeated all the
monsters in sight, you can rest until you're healed with ‘[color=yellow]r[/color]’, but make sure
you're somewhere safe! Monsters can still stumble until you while you're
resting.

Various items can be found throughout the dungeon; they’re typically
represented by non-alphanumeric symbols. The majority of these will be useful
to you (especially the ethereal ore that you’re trying to recover!). If there’s
an item on the space you’re standing on, you can press ‘[color=yellow]g[/color]’ to pick it up. If
multiple items are present, this will take you to a screen allowing you to pick
which items you want to take. Be careful of taking too much, though! If you try
and carry too much, you’ll become overburdened and unable to move.

Once you’ve been in the dungeon long enough, you may start to acquire
mutations. These can give you new abilities, or effect your stats. On the other
hand, some have no effect at all.

Any abilities you’ve gained can be activated by pressing ‘[color=yellow]a[/color]’. They offer access
to more powerful attacks and special abilities you cannot otherwise use, but be
careful when using them as abilities cost energy to activate, so you can only
use them so much.
